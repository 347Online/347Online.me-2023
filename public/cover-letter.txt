I build Full-Stack Web Apps, APIs, User Interfaces, developer tooling,
and video games.

I want to be an outstanding member of an even more outstanding team. I
strive to foster a culture of camaraderie, trust, and commitment to
doing what’s right. I’m looking to tackle technical problems with
solutions that are correct, maintainable, and efficient — in that order.
My aim is to make the world a better place and leave things better than
I found them.

I take tremendous pride in my work so if you need something done right
from the start then look no further: I’m your new developer.

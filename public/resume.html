<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>I’ve been writing software in one way or another for as long as I can
remember. I got my start making games and fell in love with programming
as a result. I’ve created full-stack web applications, video games, game
modifications, custom tooling, even a command line interface for running
a secret santa event. I’m a hard worker and if you need something done
and done well, I’m your girl.</p>

<p>SaaS Company offering Web Platform for Employers to manage a Health
Reimbursement Arrangement for their Employees</p>
<ul>
<li>Migrated product team’s selected design system build pipeline away
from Create React App (deprecated shortly thereafter) to ViteJS
delivering superior performance and greatly improved developer
experience and iteration time</li>
<li>Built authorization architecture enforced on both backend event
handler and front-end to gate functionality unavailable based on users’
permissions</li>
<li>Automated synchronization of defined backend permissions to frontend
removing the need to redundantly modify defined permissions
manually</li>
<li>Built backend rest API for Managing Company Records of Employees
deployed to AWS Lambda</li>
<li>Created and maintained highly-customized ESLint configuration to
automatically fix many common distractions in code reviews</li>
<li>Developed custom Django quick action to quickly and accurately
repair frequently damaged company records</li>

<ul>
<li>Turing-complete Custom Programming Language preferring data
immutability bootstrapped from Rust</li>

<h4 id="jesteer-2022">Jesteer <span class="end">2022</span></h4>
<ul>
<li>Chrome Extension to automatically generate end-to-end testing for
web apps, backed by Open Source Software Accelerator, OSLabs</li>
<li>Leveraged Google Chrome’s feature-rich extensions API to automate
the generation of Puppeteer scripts, as well as integrating Jest’s
testing functionality by injecting content scripts into active webpage
which records user interactions, leading to expedited creation of
end-to-end tests</li>
<li>Developed content scripts that register listeners to the active
document, which report events back to the extension by implementing
Chrome’s message passing API, enabling communication from one end of the
application to the other</li>
<li>Took full advantage of Puppeteer (specifically built with the
Chromium Engine in mind unlike other similar frameworks such as Selenium
or Playwright which target multiple browsers) in order to construct
automated browser tests, saving engineering time</li>
<li>Further incorporated Jest and Puppeteer by building a comprehensive
test suite which verifies that the extension is acting as intended,
recording the interaction and generating the test correctly</li>
<li>Built a highly-functional and robust user interface for the
extension using vanilla web technologies (HTML/CSS/JS)</li>
<li>Created product website with the Svelte framework, capitalizing on
its short ramp-up time for building out modular components</li>
<li>Deployed to AWS using S3 for storage of static files and CloudFront
to provide the secure socket layer in order to protect connection
privacy</li>

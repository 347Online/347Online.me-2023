    <p>
      I’ve been writing software in one way or another for as long as I can
      remember. I’ve built full-stack web applications, video games and game
      modifications, even a command line interface for running a secret santa
      event. I’m a hard worker and if you need something done and done well, I’m
      your girl.

        Chrome Extension to automatically generate end-to-end testing for web
        apps, backed by Open Source Software Accelerator, OSLabs
      </li>
      <li>
        Leveraged Google Chrome’s feature-rich extensions API to automate the
        generation of Puppeteer scripts, as well as integrating Jest’s testing
        functionality by injecting content scripts into active webpage which

        tests
      </li>
      <li>
        Developed content scripts that register listeners to the active
        document, which report events back to the extension by implementing

        application to the other
      </li>
      <li>
        Further incorporated Jest and Puppeteer by building a comprehensive test
        suite which verifies that the extension is acting as intended, recording

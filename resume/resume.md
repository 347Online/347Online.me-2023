## Summary

In one way or another, I've been developing software for just about as long as I can remember.
I’ve built full-stack web applications, video games and game modifications, a command line interface for running a secret santa event, I can do it all.
I'm a hard worker so if you need something done right, look no further: I'm your new developer.

Chrome Extension to automatically generate end-to-end testing for web apps, backed by Open Source Software Accelerator, OSLabs

- Leveraged Google Chrome’s feature-rich extensions API to automate the generation of Puppeteer scripts, as well as integrating Jest’s testing functionality by injecting content scripts into active webpage which records user interactions, leading to expedited creation of end-to-end tests
- Developed content scripts that register listeners to the active document, which report events back to the extension by implementing Chrome’s message passing API, enabling communication across differently privileged domains
- Further incorporated Jest and Puppeteer by building a comprehensive test suite which verifies that the extension is acting as intended, recording the interaction and generating the test correctly
- Built a highly-functional and robust user interface for the extension using vanilla web technologies (HTML/CSS/JS)

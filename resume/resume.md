## Summary

In one way or another, I've been developing software for just about as long as I can remember.
I’ve built full-stack web applications, video games and game modifications, a command line interface for running a secret santa event, I can do it all.
I'm a hard worker so if you need something done right, look no further: I'm your new developer.

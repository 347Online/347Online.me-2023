title: Katie Janzen Cover Letter 2025
---

I build Full-Stack Web Apps, APIs, User Interfaces, developer tooling, and video games.

I want to be an outstanding member of an even more outstanding team.
I strive to foster a culture of camaraderie, trust, and commitment to doing what's right.
I'm looking to tackle technical problems with solutions that are correct, maintainable, and efficient --- in that order.
My aim is to make the world a better place and leave things better than I found them.

I take tremendous pride in my work so if you need something done right from the start then look no further: I'm your new developer.
